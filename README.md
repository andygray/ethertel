# ethertel

Telephony exchange to enable micro-payment telephone calls around the world. Providers can lock international rate cards into smart-contracts and the end-users only ever pay for exact amount of the call!

## Browser Voip Client

Simple payphone web based voip client: 

* A user can enter their seed password in the client to sign into their Ethereum account. This will need a balance > 0 to make telephone calls (to landlines/mobiles)
* User only pays for the call, they enter a (international/local) telephone number and estimated minutes and will receive an quote in ether (based on the best rate on the exchange). They can then place the call and send the required ether. Once the call completes the client will be informed of the cost and refunded any unused ether.
* User can see previous transactions made. Call Number/Call Duration/Call Cost/Call Rate
